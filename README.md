# 5 Second Rule - Rendering Framework

## Contributing

[Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/)

When you want to add a feature, don't work on the master branch! The master branch should always be in a working state. Instead, make a feature branch, e.g. `git checkout fancy-lighting-model`. Then work on that branch locally, committing to `fancy-lighting-model` (it's okay to push up a feature branch if you want). Then, when you are ready to merge back into master, make a pull request so that everyone has a chance to review your code changes. Then merge the branch with `--no-ff` so that we keep the branch history.
